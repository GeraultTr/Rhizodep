RhizoDep corresponds to a model intended to simulate rhizodeposition processes, i.e. the release of organic materials by the root system into the soil. As a first step, the focus is made on the exudation of hexose sugars (glucose and fructose) depending on the concentration of sugars inside the root. An exudation flux is therefore defined for each root segment or apex as a function of the gradient of hexose concentration inside and outside the root element.
